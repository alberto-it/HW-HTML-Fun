        <h3>The following is a recipe for Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies...</h3>
        <div class="ingredients">Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">Steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
                </li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and
                    vanilla extract until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry
                    ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the
                    dough.</li>
                <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches
                    apart.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before
                    transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
                </li>
            </ul>
